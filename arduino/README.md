# Arduino Source Code and Libraries

This folder contains the source code for the Arduino IOT-devices. It follows the same folder structure as the Arduino sketchbook, 
so it can be copied to the Arduino Sketchbook folder (usually /Documents/Arduino) and directly uploaded to the devices from the Arduino IDE.
